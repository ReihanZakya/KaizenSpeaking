# Kaizen Speaking 🎤📱

Kaizen Speaking is a platform powered by AI designed to help individuals enhance their public speaking and communication skills. Many people struggle with speaking confidently because they lack structured, personalized feedback. Kaizen Speaking solves this problem by analyzing recorded speeches and providing detailed feedback on critical aspects like fluency, articulation, intonation, and emotional expression. This feedback empowers users to understand their strengths and weaknesses, making it easier for them to improve. 💬✨

This project uses advanced machine learning models, including **Whisper** for speech-to-text transcription and **LLaMA** for analyzing speech quality. These models have been fine-tuned to work effectively with Indonesian speech, ensuring accurate and meaningful feedback. The app, developed with Kotlin, offers a simple and user-friendly experience, allowing users to view their performance results and track their progress in real-time. 📈📱

The backend is hosted on **Google Cloud**, ensuring that the system is secure, scalable, and capable of processing data efficiently. Kaizen Speaking was created to make speech training more accessible and practical, especially for students and professionals looking to improve their communication skills. 🚀
